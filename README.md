# dj-bot
A Discord bot for playing Youtube songs in voice channels. Most of its code was copied from the [Songbird examples](https://github.com/serenity-rs/songbird/tree/current/examples/serenity/voice).

### There are a million music bots, so why does this one exist?

I was frustrated with Youtube's takedown of every music-playing discord bot that I've used, so I decided to make and host my own.
